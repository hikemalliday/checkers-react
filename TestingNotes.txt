-INSIDE PACKAGE.JSON:
    -We changed 'type' from 'module' to 'commonjs'

-TESTING NOTES:
    -We may need to jest.mock() things, because boardState and setBoardState are at the root
    -So, at Board.tsx level, we could:
        -jest.mock(boardState);
        -jest.mock(setBoardState);
        -Will likely need to mock all the game attributes at this level
    -Can we test moving a piece?
